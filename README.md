This is the unstable development branch. See the
[stable branch](https://github.com/pallet/pallet/tree/support/0.7.x) for
production code.

[Pallet][palletops] is used to provision and maintain servers on cloud and
virtual machine infrastructure, and aims to solve the problem of providing a
consistently configured running image across a range of clouds.  It is designed
for use from the [Clojure][clojure] REPL, from clojure code, and from the
command line.

- reuse configuration in development, testing and production.
- store all your configuration in a source code management system (eg. git),
  including role assignments.
- configuration is re-used by compostion; just create new functions that call
  existing crates with new arguments. No copy and modify required.
- enable use of configuration crates (recipes) from versioned jar files.

It uses [jclouds][jclouds] to gain portable access to different cloud providers.

[Documentation][docs] is available.

## Crates

Pallet installation and configuration for various software packages is provided
via crates.  For pallet 0.4.x through 0.6.x, the crates are in the
[pallet-crates](https://github.com/pallet/pallet-crates) repo. For 0.7.x and
on, each crate is in its own repository.

## Support

On the [mailing list][ml], or #pallet on freenode irc.

## Usage

The main [documentation][docs] is on the [PalletOps][palletops] site.

## Installation

Pallet is distributed as a jar, and is available in the
[sonatype repository][sonatype].

Installation is with maven or your favourite maven repository aware build tool.
