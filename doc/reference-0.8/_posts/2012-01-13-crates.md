Crates are namespaces that encapsulate some unit of configuration or
administration. A crate contains plan functions.  A plan function is an ordinary
clojure function.

The [`pallet.crate/defplan`]({{site.baseurl}}/api/0.8/pallet.crate.html#var-defplan) macro is
used to create a plan function that provides a context used in log output.

## Composing Existing Crates and Actions

The simplest way of creating a crate is to compose it from existing crates or
[actions]({{site.baseurl}}/doc/reference/0.8/actions). In this example we assume there is a
`git` and a `tomcat` crate.

``` clojure
(require '[pallet.crate :refer [defplan]])
(require '[pallet.actions :refer [package]])
(require '[pallet.crate.git :refer [git]])
(require '[pallet.crate.tomcat :refer [tomcat]])

(defplan my-simple-config
  []
  (package "maven2")
  (git)
  (tomcat))
```

## Extending Pallet's Actions

### Creating actions
`defaction` can be used to define script producing functions, that can then
be called in crates.

### Aggregate action

`defaggregate` can be used to define actions that collect arguments over
multiple invocations and emit a action based on the aggregated arguments.
This is used in the sudoers crate, for example, to emit /etc/sudoers.

### Local actions
`def-clj-action` defines a action that will be run on the local machine.
