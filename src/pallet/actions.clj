The `remote-file` action can specify the content of a remote file in a number
different ways.

By default, the remote-file is versioned, and 5 versions are kept.

The remote content is also verified against it's md5 hash.  If the contents
of the remote file have changed (e.g. have been edited on the remote machine)
then by default the file will not be overwritten, and an error will be raised.
To force overwrite, call `set-force-overwrite` before running `converge` or
`lift`.

Options for specifying the file's content are:
`url`
: download the specified url to the given filepath

`content`
: use the specified content directly

`local-file`
: use the file on the local machine at the given path

`remote-file`
: use the file on the remote machine at the given path

`link`
: file to link to

`literal`
: prevent shell expansion on content

`md5`
: md5 for file

`md5-url`
: a url containing file's md5

`template`
: specify a template to be interpolated

`values`
: values for interpolation

`blob`
: map of `container`, `path`

`blobstore`
: a jclouds blobstore object (override blobstore in session)

`insecure`
: boolean to specify ignoring of SLL certs

Options for version control are:

`overwrite-changes`
: flag to force overwriting of locally modified content

`no-versioning`
: do not version the file

`max-versions`
: specfy the number of versions to keep (default 5)

`flag-on-changed`
: flag to set if file is changed

Options for specifying the file's permissions are:

`owner`
: user-name

`group`
: group-name

`mode`
: file-mode

Options for verifying the file's content:

`verify`
: a command to run on the file on the node, before it is installed

To copy the content of a local file to a remote file:
    (remote-file session \"remote/path\" :local-file \"local/path\")

To copy the content of one remote file to another remote file:
    (remote-file session \"remote/path\" :remote-file \"remote/source/path\")

To link one remote file to another remote file:
    (remote-file session \"remote/path\" :link \"remote/source/path\")

To download a url to a remote file:
    (remote-file session \"remote/path\" :url \"http://a.com/path\")

If a url to a md5 file is also available, then it can be specified to prevent
unnecessary downloads and to verify the download.

    (remote-file session \"remote/path\"
      :url \"http://a.com/path\"
      :md5-url \"http://a.com/path.md5\")
