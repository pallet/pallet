"Core functionality is provided in `lift` and `converge`.

- node           :: A node in the compute service
- node-spec      :: A specification for a node. The node-spec provides an image
                    hardware, location and network template for starting new
                    nodes.
- server-spec    :: A specification for a server. This is a map of phases and
                    a default node-spec. A server-spec has the following keys
                    :phase, :packager and node-spec keys.
- group-spec     :: A group of identically configured nodes, represented as a
                    map with :group-name, :count and server-spec keys.
                    The group-name is used to link running nodes to their
                    configuration (via pallet.compute.Node/group-name)
- group          :: A group of identically configured nodes, represented as a
                    group-spec, together with the servers that are running
                    for that group-spec.
- group name     :: The name used to identify a group.
- server         :: A map used to descibe the node, image, etc of a single
                    node running as part of a group. A server has the
                    following keys :group-name, :node, :node-id and server-spec
                    keys.
- phase list     :: A list of phases to be used
- action plan    :: A list of actions that should be run."
