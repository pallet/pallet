"Pallet is a functional configuration management system, that can be used to
provision and manage configured compute nodes.

It uses a declaritive map for specifying the number of nodes with a given tag.
Each tag is used to look up a machine image template specification (in jclouds),
and to configuration information (in chef).  The converge function then
tries to bring you compute servers into alignment with your declared counts and
configurations.

The bootstrap process for new compute nodes installs a user with sudo
permissions, using the specified username and password. The installed user is
used to execute the chef cookbooks.

Once the nodes are bootstrapped, and fall all existing nodes
the configured node information is written to the \"compute-nodes\" cookbook
before chef is run, and this provides a :compute_nodes attribute.  The
compute-nodes cookbook is expected to exist in the site-cookbooks of the
chef-repository you specify with `with-chef-repository`.

   node-set can be a node type, a sequence of node types, or a map

   each matching node.

   Options:
    :compute         a jclouds compute service
    :compute-service a map of :provider, :identity, :credential, and
                     optionally :extensions for constructing a jclouds compute
