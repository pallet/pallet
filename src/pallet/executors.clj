(ns pallet.executors
  "Action executors for pallet.

   An action has a :action-type. Known types include :script
   and :fn/clojure.

   An action has a :location, :origin for execution on the node running
   pallet, and :target for the target node.

   The action-type determines how the action should be handled:

   :script - action produces script for execution on remote machine
   :fn/clojure  - action is a function for local execution
   :transfer/to-local - action is a function specifying remote source
                        and local destination.
   :transfer/from-local - action is a function specifying local source
                          and remote destination."
