  "Plan function code transformation.

We plan functions to meet most peoples expectations of how clojure functions
should work.  In order for this to happen, we need to hide the difference
between action plan building, and action plan execution.

node-values are placeholders for execution time values.

- If a plan function uses a node-value in an expression, then that expression
  needs to be evaluated at runtime.

- If the expression is used to control a conditional branch, then the
  conditional needs to be rewritten to us the plan conditional macros.

This is complicated by the fact that node-values can be passed as arguments to
plan functions.  This means that the distinction may have to occur at runtime,
or that we assume arguments are not node-values, and require the user to adjust
if they are (is this advanced use?)."

;;; ## Plan Function AST Transformation

;;; The transformation is based on using :pallet/plan-fn metadata on pallet's
;;; actions and plan functions to identify the values that are not available
;;; until execution time.

;;; In order to make this information available, we add a map of local bindings
;;; using the :pallet/local-env, that maps from local symbol to a map of
;;; properties, that will contain a :pallet/node-value member for locals bound
;;; to expressions containing execution time values.
