(ns pallet.action
  "Actions implement the conversion of phase functions to script and other
   execution code.

   An action has a :action-type. Known types include :script/bash
   and :fn/clojure.

   An action has a :location, :origin for execution on the node running
   pallet, and :target for the target node.

   An action has an :execution, which is one of :aggregated, :in-sequence or
   :collected. Calls to :aggregated actions will be grouped, and run before
   :in-sequence actions. Calls to :collected actions will be grouped, and run
   after :in-sequence actions."

;;; action defining functions

(defn schedule-action
  "Registers an action in the action plan. The action is generated by the
   specified action function and arguments that will be applied to the function
   when the action plan is executed.

   The action can be scheduled within one of three 'executions'
   (conceptually, sub-phases):

   :in-sequence - The generated action will be applied to the node
        \"in order\", as it is defined lexically in the source crate.
        This is the default.
   :aggregated - All aggregated actions are applied to the node
        in the order they are defined, but before all :in-sequence
        actions. Note that all of the arguments to any given
        action function are gathered such that there is only ever one
        invocation of each fn within each phase.
   :collected - All collected actions are applied to the node
        in the order they are defined, but after all :in-sequence
        action. Note that all of the arguments to any given
        action function are gathered such that there is only ever one
        invocation of each fn within each phase.

   The action-type determines how the action should be handled:

   :script/bash - action produces bash script for execution on remote machine
   :fn/clojure  - action is a function for local execution
   :transfer/to-local - action is a function specifying remote source
                        and local destination.
   :transfer/from-local - action is a function specifying local source
                          and remote destination."
