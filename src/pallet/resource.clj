  "Registers a resource whose generation is defined by the specified

   when the associated phase is applied to a node.

   The invocation can be scheduled within one of two 'executions'
   (conceptually, sub-phases):

   :in-sequence - The generated resource will be applied to the node
        \"in order\", as it is defined lexically in the source crate.
        This is the default.
   :aggregated - All aggregated resources are applied to the node
        in the order they are defined, but before all :in-sequence
        resources. Note that all of the arguments to any given
        invocation fn are gathered such that there is only ever one
        invocation of each fn within each phase.
   :collected - All collected resources are applied to the node
        in the order they are defined, but after all :in-sequence
        resources. Note that all of the arguments to any given
        invocation fn are gathered such that there is only ever one
        invocation of each fn within each phase.

   The resource-type determines how the invocation should be handled:

   :script/bash - resource produce bash script for execution on remote machine
   :fn/clojure  - resource is a function for local execution
   :transfer/to-local - resource is a function specifying remote source
        and local destination."
