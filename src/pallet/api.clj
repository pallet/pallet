(defn converge
  "Converge the existing compute resources with the counts specified in
`group-spec->count`. New nodes are started, or nodes are destroyed to obtain the
specified node counts.

`group-spec->count` can be a map from group-spec to node count, or can be a
sequence of group-specs containing a :count key.

This applies the `:bootstrap` phase to all new nodes and, by default,
the :configure phase to all running nodes whose group-name matches a key in the
node map.  Phases can also be specified with the `:phase` option, and will be
applied to all matching nodes.  The :configure phase is the default phase
applied.

## Options

`:compute`
: a compute service.

`:phase`
: a phase keyword, phase function, or sequence of these.

`:user`
the admin-user on the nodes.

### Partitioning

`:partition-f`
: a function that takes a sequence of targets, and returns a sequence of
  sequences of targets.  Used to partition or filter the targets.  Defaults to
  any :partition metadata on the phase, or no partitioning otherwise.

## Post phase options

`:post-phase-f`
: specifies an optional function that is run after a phase is applied.  It is
  passed `targets`, `phase` and `results` arguments, and is called before any
  error checking is done.  The return value is ignored, so this is for side
  affect only.

`:post-phase-fsm`
: specifies an optional fsm returning function that is run after a phase is
  applied.  It is passed `targets`, `phase` and `results` arguments, and is
  called before any error checking is done.  The return value is ignored, so
  this is for side affect only.

### Asynchronous and Timeouts

`:async`
: a flag to control whether the function executes asynchronously.  When truthy,
  the function returns an Operation that can be deref'd like a future.  When not
  truthy, `:timeout-ms` may be used to specify a timeout.  Defaults to nil.

`:timeout-ms`
: an integral number of milliseconds to wait for completion before timeout.
  Only applies if `:async` is not truthy (the default).

`:timeout-val`
: a value to be returned should the operation time out.

### Algorithm options

`:phase-execution-f`
: specifies the function used to execute a phase on the targets.  Defaults
  to `pallet.core.primitives/build-and-execute-phase`.

`:execution-settings-f`
: specifies a function that will be called with a node argument, and which
  should return a map with `:user`, `:executor` and `:executor-status-fn` keys."

(defn lift
  "Lift the running nodes in the specified node-set by applying the specified
phases.  The compute service may be supplied as an option, otherwise the
bound compute-service is used.  The configure phase is applied by default
unless other phases are specified.

node-set can be a group spec, a sequence of group specs, or a map
of group specs to nodes. Examples:

    [group-spec1 group-spec2 {group-spec #{node1 node2}}]
    group-spec
    {group-spec #{node1 node2}}

## Options:

`:compute`
: a compute service.

`:phase`
: a phase keyword, phase function, or sequence of these.

`:user`
the admin-user on the nodes.

### Partitioning

`:partition-f`
: a function that takes a sequence of targets, and returns a sequence of
  sequences of targets.  Used to partition or filter the targets.  Defaults to
  any :partition metadata on the phase, or no partitioning otherwise.

## Post phase options

`:post-phase-f`
: specifies an optional function that is run after a phase is applied.  It is
  passed `targets`, `phase` and `results` arguments, and is called before any
  error checking is done.  The return value is ignored, so this is for side
  affect only.

`:post-phase-fsm`
: specifies an optional fsm returning function that is run after a phase is
  applied.  It is passed `targets`, `phase` and `results` arguments, and is
  called before any error checking is done.  The return value is ignored, so
  this is for side affect only.

### Asynchronous and Timeouts

`:async`
: a flag to control whether the function executes asynchronously.  When truthy,
  the function returns an Operation that can be deref'd like a future.  When not
  truthy, `:timeout-ms` may be used to specify a timeout.  Defaults to nil.

`:timeout-ms`
: an integral number of milliseconds to wait for completion before timeout.
  Only applies if `:async` is not truthy (the default).

`:timeout-val`
: a value to be returned should the operation time out.

### Algorithm options

`:phase-execution-f`
: specifies the function used to execute a phase on the targets.  Defaults
  to `pallet.core.primitives/build-and-execute-phase`.

`:execution-settings-f`
: specifies a function that will be called with a node argument, and which
  should return a map with `:user`, `:executor` and `:executor-status-fn` keys."

provides a way of lifting phases, which doesn't tie you to working with all
nodes in a group.  Consider using this only if the functionality in `lift` is
insufficient.

`phases`
: a sequence of phase keywords (identifying phases) or plan functions, that
  should be applied to the target nodes.  Note that there are no default phases.

## Options:

`:user`
: the admin-user to use for operations on the target nodes.

`:environment`
: an environment map, to be merged into the environment.

`:plan-state`
: an state map, which can be used to passing settings across multiple lift-nodes
  invocations.

`:async`
: a flag to control whether the function executes asynchronously.  When truthy,
  the function returns an Operation that can be deref'd like a future.  When not
  truthy, `:timeout-ms` may be used to specify a timeout.  Defaults to nil.
