(ns pallet.action-plan
  "An action plan contains actions for execution.

   The action plan is built by executing a phase function. Each phase function
   calls actions which insert themselves into the action plan.

   The action plan is transformed to provide aggregated operations, and to
   resolve precedence relations between actions.

   A translated plan is executed by passing an executor, which is a map
   from action type to function.  The executor functions are called with the
   result of evaluating the action with it's arguments."
